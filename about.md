Lorem markdownum aequalis strigis. _Saetigeri iubeas_, vultu huic alvum nondum
de obside ut laniavit arbor palmis, cum quin. Rupes vetat videndo, armigerae
crimen habet Priamum nec.

## Business Process Analysis
   - **Identification of processes subject to:**
      - automation,

## IT Workforce Optimization

   - **Designing the minimally required team structure:**
     - Preserving internal control and know-how,
     - Possibility of outsourcing secondary or non-critical roles.

      - flexibility,
      - resilience to market changes.

## Methods and Tools

# Case Study Example
Company X spends €1.5 million annually on Microsoft and SAP licenses. An analysis revealed that 30% of the functionality was unused. Our team proposed:
   - **Replacing part of the licensed solutions with open-source alternatives (e.g., Odoo, OnlyOffice),**
   - **Automating 2 key business processes through RPA scenarios,**
   - **Reducing the DSI team from 15 to 9 people, outsourcing 3 roles.**

Resulting savings: more than €600,000 per year.
